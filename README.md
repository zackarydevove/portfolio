<h1> Projects </h1>

<h2> 2. Twitter Clone </h2>
A full stack web application that mimics the core functionality of Twitter. This project highlights my skills in building real-time, social media applications using the MERN stack, complete with user authentication, tweet creation, retweeting, liking, a feed of tweets and instant messaging using socket.io.

<h2> 3. Transcendence </h2>
A modern twist on classic Pong. Developed with Next, TypeScript, Tailwind, Nest and more by a team of 5 using Azure. Features real-time matchmaking, integrated chat, and more with an intuitive UI/UX I made.

<h2> 4. Soliswap </h2>
Soliswap is a Decentralized Exchange inspired by Uniswap, developed to deepen my understanding of the web3 stack. Deployed on the Ethereum testnet, it enables users to swap cryptocurrencies, manage liquidity pools, and engage in staking and farming with their LPs.
